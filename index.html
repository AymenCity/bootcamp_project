      <h3>Aymen Said</h3>
      <p>I've had some programming experience with Python as I did Computer Science for both GCSE and A-Level.
      </p>

      <p>This is my first time using Java in Processing and I have learned a lot over the past 2 weeks and I hope that my knowledge in coding improves in the future.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D Cube Simulator</h3>
    <p>The project that I produced after the 2 week bootcamp at City.</p>
    <p>Sorry if the video quality isn't the best, my mic wasn't working. But you should be able to have an idea on how the program works as I have added comments within my sketch and demostrated a video of the code running.</p>
    <p>I decided to create a fully animated 3D cube that rotates at 3 different dimensions at different velocity.</p>
    <p>I have used loops and classes within my program so that it creates individual blocks to form a cube in 3 different dimensions.</p>
    <p>It is also interactive as it allows the users to customise the cube to their preferred colour.</p>
    <p>This interactive tool in my program will also allow users to adjust the velocity and the size of the individual blocks and cube.</p>
    <p>Within my sketch, I added a GUI which gives instructions to the user.</p>
