# bootcamp_project
Name: Aymen Said
The project that I produced after the 2 week bootcamp at City

It's a fully animated 3D cube that rotates at 3 different dimensions at different velocity.
I have used loops within my program so that it creates individual blocks to form a cube in 3 different dimensions.
It is also interactive as it allows the users to customise the cube to their preferred colour.
This interactive tool in my program will also allow users to adjust the velocity and the size of the individual blocks and cube.
